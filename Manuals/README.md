# Smokeview Manuals

All of the Smokeview manuals are contained within the sub-directories above. Each sub-directory contains a bash script named `make_guide.sh` 
and a windows batch file named `make_guide.bat` that run PDF-LaTeX and BibTeX enough times to compile the guide and update the references. Each manual directory contains directories `FIGURES` and `SCRIPT_FIGURES`, the latter containing figures that are generated by scripts and not committed to the repository.

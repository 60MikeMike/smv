# fds-smv
Fire Dynamics Simulator and Smokeview


*Build directory*

This directory provides scripts and makefiles for building smokeview and other programs such as smokediff and smokezip.  
Scripts exist for building these applications on Windows, Linux and OSX
platforms.
Most of these scripts assume you have an Intel C/C++ compiler installed.  Smokeview, smokediff and smokezip also
assume you have an Intel Fortran Compiler installed.  Linux and OSX build directories also have scripts for building
these applications using gnu compilers (gcc and gfortran).
